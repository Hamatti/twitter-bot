<h1> Links gathering Twitter bot </h1>

<h2> Background </h2>
Twitter is a great service but staying sane with millions of tweets all the time, it needs some tools. I'm interested in data science: machine learning, data visualisation, databases, so I decided to create a script that fetches me interesting links to articles.

<h2> Features </h2>
The script fetches tweets containing the word <i>'data'</i> and a link. The script then stores the link, username and date alongside with the title of the page to database for further examination. 

In the future, my intentions is to make the script learning so it can filter all the non-interesting stuff out for me.
